    <p>Awesome movie.  It totally blew my mind.  So crazy.  I can't believe that everybody died at the end.</p>

    <p>Somewhat of a disappointment.  It definitely didn't live up to all the hype.  There were definitely some
      great scenes, but also some pointless ones.  At least that's what my friends told me.</p>
